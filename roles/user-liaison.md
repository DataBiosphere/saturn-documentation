# User Liaison
The user liaison is a role within the Saturn team that addresses issues that block only a few users on prod (whereas on-call addresses issues that block many users on prod) The only requirements to participate in the user liaison process are having a development setup. The user liaison is responsible for watching #saturn and #workbench-userliaison (the userliaison channel is private. If you want access for user liaison duties, message a member of the comms team)

## Typical flow
A user issue comes in through one of the channels. The user liaison jumps on to find a root cause, then either:
* If the issue is large, make a bug ticket to bring in later, and let the reporter know you have filed a ticket
* If the issue is small enough, file a ticket to address immediately, bring the ticket into the sprint, and let the team (and especially product owner) know

## Why we have the role
The user liaison's job is to beb a buffer against the world for the team. However, if the UL needs help, they can and should ask the team. (Their role is to handle initial triage, but in the spirit of the UL not needing to have all the answers, the team is encouraged to lift and support the UL)
