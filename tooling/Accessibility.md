# Accessibility Tooling

## ANDI
[ANDI](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html) is the accessibility tool used by the NIH, and is used as our primary tool for discovering accessibility issues. To use, follow the installation instructions on the website linked, and then open the bookmarklet on the website you wish to analyze. Items you wish to analyze for accessibility issues will be highlighted. On the ANDI panel as well, there is a dropdown that starts with 'focusable elements' selected. This dropdown allows you to select multiple different options for accessibility.

## AXE Screen Reader
For screen reading analysis, we use [AXE](https://www.deque.com/axe/). To use, install the [free chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-web-accessibility-tes/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd). This will add a new tab to your developer tools, which you can use to analyze the page for screen reader issues.
